This Master's level course examines the social, legal, and political implications of artificial intelligence (AI). The course aims to introduce computer science students to perspectives from the social sciences and humanities on AI. Throughout the semester, students explore topics related to AI discrimination, explainable AI, auditing, regulation, critical dataset studies, and more. The main teaching objectives of the course are to teach students how to 1) critically analyze the ethical, social, and political implications of artificial intelligence (AI) through lenses other than computer science; 2) apply theories and concepts from the social sciences and humanities to examine sociotechnical systems; and 3) reflect on and evaluate proposals on how to develop and deploy AI in high-risk environments.
