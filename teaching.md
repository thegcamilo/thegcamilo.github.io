Offered in [WS 25/26](vvz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/campus/all/event.asp?gguid=0xE1CC2BF89382409FB7809D38FFA9A119&from=vvz&mode=own&tabID=1&tguid=0x72A1F066AE364472A0A8EFF9E1FC2DD1&objgguid=0x5F1DD6158D6F4B79A8B5DDFBB97D5954&lang=en)

This Master's level course examines the social, legal, and political implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Although designed for computer science students, this course aims to introduce students to perspectives from the social sciences and humanities. Throughout the semester, students explore topics related to AI discrimination, explainable AI, auditing, regulation, critical dataset studies, and more. The course seeks to teach students how to 1) critically analyze the ethical, social, and political implications of artificial intelligence (AI) through lenses other than computer science; 2) apply theories and concepts from the social sciences and humanities to examine sociotechnical systems; and 3) reflect on and evaluate proposals on how to develop and deploy AI in high-risk environments.
