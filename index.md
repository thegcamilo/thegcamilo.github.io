<!-- ## About Me -->

<img class="profile-picture" src="assets/prof_pic.jpg">

Hi! My name is Gabriel Lima. I am currently a Doctoral Researcher (i.e., PhD Candidate) at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP), where I work alongside [Yixin Zou](https://yixinzou.github.io/). Before joining MPI-SP, I obtained my BSc and MSc from KAIST, where I worked with [Meeyoung Cha](https://www.mpi-sp.org/cha).

I am a human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher interested in responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). Through my work, I seek to embed the public's perceptions and opinions of consequential AI systems into debates concerning their real-world ethical, social, and legal implications. My overarching objective is to ensure that the development and governance of AI reflect the values, expectations, and opinions of the people who use and are affected by these systems.

My work primarily focuses on three interconnected directions:
- Examining people’s expectations and opinions of high-risk AI systems to inform real-world ethical, social, and legal debates surrounding AI <small>[[CHI 2026a](), [CHI 2025a](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713338), [Cambridge 2025](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009170901.028), [FAccT 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3593992), [EAAMO 2022](https://eaamo.org/papers/grgic-hlaca-22.pdf), [CHI 2021](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445260), [Frontiers 2021a](https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.756242)]</small>;
- Experimentally investigating how the predominant debates on AI—and different perspectives about them—shape the public’s perceptions <small>[[CHI 2025b](https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713536), [CHI 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580953), [Frontiers 2021b](https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.719944), [CSCW 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3415206)]
</small>;
- Analyzing the predominant perspectives on the ethical, social, and legal questions raised by AI, as well as the solutions put forward to address them <small>[[CHI 2026b](), [CSCW 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3710935), [FAccT 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3534628)]</small>.

My research employs quantitative, qualitative, and computational methods to capture and make sense of narratives about AI and people's perceptions and opinions. My approach to research is highly interdisciplinary. I have collaborated with scholars from psychology, law, sociology, communication, and other disciplines, always aiming to bring different disciplinary perspectives together.

I interrogate the prevailing narratives surrounding AI, explore how they shape laypeople's understanding of the technology, and seek to identify strategies to promote more grounded perceptions of real-world AI systems.  -->
<!-- I also explore whether and how the public opinion about AI can inform AI governance to ensure that AI d benefits those subjected to consequential AI systems. -->

<!-- During my BS and MS, I investigated people's perceptions of moral and legal responsibility for algorithmic decision-making. My research focused on capturing who people consider responsible when AI causes harm to embed laypeople's opinions in normative research and policymaking to mitigate potential conflicts between folk expectations and AI governance.  -->
