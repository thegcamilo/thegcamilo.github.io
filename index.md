## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="prof_pic.jpg">

Hi! My name is Gabriel Lima. I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP), where I work alongside [Yixin Zou](https://yixinzou.github.io/). Before joining MPI-SP, where I obtained my BS and MS from KAIST, where I worked with [Meeyoung Cha](https://www.mpi-sp.org/cha).

My research interests reside at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) ethics. I interrogate the prevailing narratives surrounding AI, explore how they shape laypeople's understanding of the technology, and seek to identify strategies to promote more grounded perceptions of real-world AI systems. I also explore whether and how the public opinion about AI can inform AI governance to ensure that it benefits those subjected to consequential AI systems.

During my PhD, I have focused on investigating how different ways of talking about AI and its ethical implications can shape the public's perception of AI systems. My research approach is highly interdisciplinary; I collaborate with scholars from psychology, law, sociology, and communication and employ quantitative and computational methods to capture and make sense of narratives about AI and people's perceptions and opinions.  

During my BS and MS, I investigated people's perceptions of moral and legal responsibility for algorithmic decision-making. My research focused on capturing who people consider responsible when AI causes harm to embed laypeople's opinions in normative research and policymaking to mitigate potential conflicts between folk expectations and AI governance.
