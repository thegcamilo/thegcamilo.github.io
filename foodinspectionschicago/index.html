							<h2>Racism in the United States</h2>
							<p>Racism is arguably institutionalized in American society. Result of almost 100 years of slavery and consequent lack of opportunity for the black population to get back on their feet has created various barriers to this certain group of people. This situation has led to the exclusion of the black population from health, educational, social, and economic resources. Data suggests that <a href="https://www.mhanational.org/issues/black-african-american-communities-and-mental-health">black Americans are more likely to suffer from mental illness</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/being-black-in-america-can-be-hazardous-to-your-health/561740/">can live up to 20 years less than an average white American</a>, and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019038.pdf">do not have the same higher level education opportunities</a>.</p>

							<h2>Inequality Food Distribution</h2>
							<p>Another important problem in the current worldwide situation is the precarious food distribution across the world. For instance, <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/devastating-consequences-unequal-food-access#ucs-report-downloads">diabetes has hit minorities the hardest</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100893540">many layers of society worldwide suffer of poverty</a>. However, there has not been any analysis on the quality of food provided to different social and racial groups in a certain location. Following the trend of minorities receiving lower quality services and products, we hypothesize that the same would follow in terms of the quality of the food available to the black and poorest population. Therefore, we ask the following research question:</p>

							<h2>Does the quality of food available to different racial and economic groups differ significantly?</h2>

							<h2>Methodology</h2>
							<p>In order to answer our question, we utilized a <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5">dataset of food inspections in the city of Chicago</a>. We use the results of the inspections as a proxy for a measure of food quality in a certain location. If a certain neighborhood has a higher failure rate, we can infer that the food available there is of lower quality. As a form of measuring economic and racial variables in the city of Chicago, we also obtained <a href="http://www.actforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Census-Data-by-Chicago-Community-Area-2017.pdf">information about the racial distribution across neighborhoods</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/hardship-index/792q-4jtu">the city of Chicagoâ€™s measurement of social and economic hardship </a>, and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2">data regarding crimes committed in the city</a>. With these datasets, we divide our main research question in three different sub-questions:</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section class="wrapper style1 align-center">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>1) Do neighborhoods with a higher concentration of black people have lower quality food available?</h2>
							<h2>2) Does economic and social hardship correlate with food quality in a certain neighborhood?</h2>
							<h2>3) Do neighborhoods with a higher crime rate present lower food quality?</h2>
					</section>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Food Inspections</h2>
							<p>The dataset provided by the city government identifies in which restaurant the inspection was conducted, the final result, violations, risk, location, and date. With this information, we calculate 6 measures of food quality and food inspections for each neighborhood. 
								<ol>
									<li>Inspections per capita: Number of inspections conducted in a certain neighborhood divided by the neighborhood's population.</li>
									<li>Rate of failure: Percentage of inspections that received "Fail" in a certain neighborhood.</li>
									<li>Average risk: The average risk given by inspectors of all establishments in a certain neighborhood.</li>
									<li>Violations per capita: Average number of food violations per citizens of a neighborhood.</li>
									<li>Inspections per establishment: Average number of inspections divided by the number of establishments of a neighborhood.</li>
									<li>Violations per establishment: Average number of food violations divided by the number of establishments of a neighborhood.</li>
								</ol>
								We aimed to analyze whether there is some correlation between inspection results and the composition of a neighborhood in terms of race and economy. Note that 1) and 5) do not measure food quality, but how often inspections are conducted. We also aim to understand whether there is a bias on where inspections are conducted.

							<h2>Census Data</h2>
							<p>Among all the variables obtained in the US nationwide census, we only used two factors for our project. First, we obtained each neighborhood's population so we can normalize our measurements according to the population size of a neighborhood, and its racial distribution, as a measure of how many citizens belong to racial minorities.</p>

							<h2>Hardship Index</h2>
							<p>The city of Chicago also makes available the economic hardship of all its community areas. The economic hardship index is a function of:
								<ul>
									<li>Unemployment (over the age of 16 years)</li>
									<li>Education (over 25 years of age without a high school diploma)</li>
									<li>Per capita income level</li>
									<li>Poverty (below the federal poverty level)</li>
									<li>Crowded housing (housing units with more than one person per room)</li>
									<li>Dependency (population under 18 or over 64 years of age)</li>
								</ul>
						We used the economic hardship index as a measurement of economic conditions of each community area in Chicago. A higher index indicates poorer conditions.</p>

							<h2>Crime Data</h2>
							<p>This dataset was also provided by Chicago's government. It reflects reported incidents of crime of various types. We have chosen to remove crimes that do not directly correlate with the level of violence of a neighborhood. For instance, we remove non-violent crimes and records of car violations as the vehicle might not belong to that certain neighborhood where the crime was reported.</p>
