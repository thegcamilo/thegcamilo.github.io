							<h2>Racism in the US</h2>
							<p>Racism is arguably institutionalized in American society. Result of almost 100 years of slavery and consequent lack of opportunity for the black population to get back on their feet has created various barriers to this certain group of people. This situation has led to the exclusion of the black population from health, educational, social, and economic resources. Data suggests that black Americans are more likely to suffer from mental illness, can live up to 20 years less than an average white American, and do not have the same higher level education opportunities.</p>

							<h2>Inequality Food Distribution</h2>
							<p>Another important problem in the current worldwide situation is the precarious food distribution across the world. Diabetes has been hit minorities the hardest and many layers of society worldwide suffer of poverty. However, there has not been any analysis on the quality of food provided to different social and racial groups in a certain location. Following the trend of minorities receiving lower quality services and products, we hypothesize that the same would follow in terms of the quality of the food available to the black and poorest population. Therefore, we ask the following research question:</p>

							<h2>Methodology</h2>
							<p>In order to answer our question, we utilized a dataset of food inspections in the city of Chicago [REF]. We use the results of the inspections as a proxy for a measure of food quality in a certain location. If a certain neighborhood has a higher failure rate, we can infer that the food available there is of lower quality. As a form of measuring economic and racial variables in the city of Chicago, we also obtained information about the racial distribution across neighborhoods [REF], the city of Chicago’s measurement of social and economic hardship [REF], and data regarding crimes committed in the city. With these datasets, we divide our main research question in three different sub-questions:</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section class="wrapper style1 align-center">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>1) Do neighborhoods with a higher concentration of black people have lower quality food available?</h2>
							<h2>2) Does economic and social hardship correlate with food quality in a certain neighborhood?</h2>
							<h2>3) Do neighborhoods with a higher crime rate present lower food quality?</h2>

							<h2>Hardship Index</h2>
							<p>The city of Chicago also makes available the economic hardship of all its community areas. The economic hardship index is a function of:
								<ul>
									<li>Unemployment (over the age of 16 years)</li>
									<li>Education (over 25 years of age without a high school diploma)</li>
									<li>Per capita income level</li>
									<li>Poverty (below the federal poverty level)</li>
									<li>Crowded housing (housing units with more than one person per room)</li>
									<li>Dependency (population under 18 or over 64 years of age)</li>
								</ul>
						We used the economic hardship index as a measurement of economic conditions of each community area in Chicago. A higher index indicates poorer conditions.</p>
